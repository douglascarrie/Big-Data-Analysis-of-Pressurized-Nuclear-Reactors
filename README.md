## Big Data Analysis of Pressurized Nuclear Reactors

#### using Python and PySpark



This project aimed to create code which could sort through large amounts of data based on Pressurized Nuclear Reactor 
Data provided by Siemens Energy

![Example of dataset](https://github.com/douglascarrie/Detecting-Bacteria-in-Blood-with-Image-Processing/blob/master/output/example.png)

##### Challenges faced in this project: 
- Using MapReduce to gain mean values from dataset 
- Obtaining higher accuracies from models


---
### Installation

You need Python, Spark, Pyspark. To run Jupyter file you will need Jupyter Notebook installed. 
Best to install with Anaconda.

Requires Small dataset and Large dataset.

Problems: 
- The larger dataset is 143mb, which exceeds GitHubs max file size

### Report

A report was created (pdf) to explain further each method used, this was done as part of an assessment.
